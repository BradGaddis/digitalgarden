The main bad guy for my game [[4-Other/Game Development/RAIGON/README\|Raigon]]. I wanted to pull inspiration from "Andross", but I went down a rabbit hole of what that might actually be referring to.

The main thing here is that this person is trying to protect our solar-system from the [[Fuharians\|Fuharians]] that are trying to take it over for its resources since they messed theirs up

The issue is that he is a monkey. I don't want to follow the "dogs vs monkeys" trope from Starfox. They have really shat on their series and I want to make a better one that can continue for as long as I would like.

I was originally going to make this a man driven mad with power, but perhaps it should be a woman instead, now that I have looked a little bit into the etymology of the word. 

Straight from the Wiki:
<p>The name is Greek (<span title="Ancient Greek-language text"><span lang="grc">Ἀνδρομέδα</span></span>, <span title="Ancient Greek-language romanization"><i lang="grc-Latn">Androméda</i></span>), perhaps meaning 'mindful of her husband': from the noun <span title="Ancient Greek-language text"><span lang="grc"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%81" class="extiw" title="wikt:ἀνήρ">ἀνήρ, ἀνδρός</a></span></span>, <span title="Ancient Greek-language romanization"><i lang="grc-Latn">anḗr, andrós</i></span> 'man'; and either the verb <span title="Ancient Greek-language text"><span lang="grc">μέδεσθαι</span></span>, <span title="Ancient Greek-language romanization"><i lang="grc-Latn">medesthai</i></span> 'to be mindful of', from <span title="Ancient Greek-language text"><span lang="grc"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%B4%CF%89" class="extiw" title="wikt:μέδω">μέδω</a></span></span>, <span title="Ancient Greek-language romanization"><i lang="grc-Latn">médō</i></span>, 'to protect, rule over', or the verb <span title="Ancient Greek-language text"><span lang="grc">μήδομαι</span></span>, <span title="Ancient Greek-language romanization"><i lang="grc-Latn">mḗdomai</i></span> 'to deliberate, contrive, decide'. These verbs are related to <span title="Ancient Greek-language text"><span lang="grc">μήδεια</span></span>, <span title="Ancient Greek-language romanization"><i lang="grc-Latn">mḗdeia</i></span> 'plans, cunning', the likely origin of the name of <a href="/wiki/Medea" title="Medea">Medea</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Goetia" title="Goetia">sorceress</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OEtymDict_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OEtymDict-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

It stems from the word "Andromeda".
