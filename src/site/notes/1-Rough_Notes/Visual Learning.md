I feel like visual learning is really just *doing*. It's the first step before actually committing the act.

A way of organizing the material by seeing it rather than simply reading it. I see this as Brilliant.org's philosophy. 

With this said, I am going to make it a point to draw more pictures for these types of things.


> “…Words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be “voluntarily” reproduced and combined…but taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought — before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.” —Albert Einstein
