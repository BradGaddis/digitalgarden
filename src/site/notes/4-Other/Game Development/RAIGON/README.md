I don't know if I will ever make this repo public, but to whom it may concern:

This game is inspired by the StarFox series -- in particular, StarFox assault.
 particular, StarFox assault. This README is more a collections of thoughts and design choices along the way. 


### My Backstory:

Making a game that is **MINE** and is fun to play has always been something I wanted to do, even as a child.

I am working on this game that I have wanted to work on for some time. I only JUST now figured out how to get the thing pushed to Github via LFS.

I am finally getting around to tackling this ambitious project. I am learning about everything as I go, so this may be a long process.

I started this project back in October of '23. I didn't know how to fully utilize Git and Github yet (and still don't really), so I ended up losing the entire project (as well as my mother) in a house fire. After the fire, I am thankful to have recovered what I did recover.

I owe this game to her. She made this possible. I deeply owe everything to her.
And I owe it to my father, who had some not-so-kind things to say about my video game habits before he passed in 2011 as well.

I loved my parents, who both passed away too young and too soon, so I want to finish something I have wanted to do my whole life for their sake.
  
I do not necessarily want to make a "hit." I just want to make *MY* game that is fun to play and runs well.

# The Design Document:

This document is a work in progress. I am kind of just making stuff up as I go along.

## Core Concept(s)

***

- A 3D StarFox inspired game that is a non-chronological release sequel to an RPG Game that I am also planning / thinking about.

### Main Mechanics #TODO
- High-speed On-Rails Shooting and Dodging
- Open-Ended Missions That Change the Route
- On-Foot Shooting/Exploration

| Exploring                                                            | Story - Driven                       | Shooting                | Multiplayer          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Shooting and "Hands-On" Game Play                                    | [[1-Rough_Notes/Andromedas\|Andromedas]] driven mad with power | Headshots Matter        | StarFox Assaut Style |
| Finding out about events from history (chronologically earlier game) | Fuharians Plotting Behind Scenes     | Scoring System          | Elimination Matches  |
| I want elements of Zelda. Chests and exploration and stuff           | Elements of Magic                    | On-Foot, Land, Air, Sea | First to points      |
|                                                                      | Choices Matter                       |                         | Melee Fisticuffs     |
|                                                                      |                                      |                         |                      |

## The core loop:
- 1. What is the player doing?
	 - Getting to the end of the level
2. What's stopping them?
	 - Hordes of enemies/monsters
3. Why are they doing it?
	- 

### Design Pillars #TODO | might remove this section
-
***




### Style
- Stylized Toon-Graphics #TODO need experience for this
- Sci-Fi #TODO need experience for this


 I have reworked the game somewhat after following Casey Muratori's [Handmade Hero](https://guide.handmadehero.org/), I have decided to rework the project a little bit, so the former milestones are not accurate. I am now following an "exploration-based" approach to this design
